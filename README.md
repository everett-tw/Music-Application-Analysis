Project Intention

Analyze datasets from Spotify and Last.fm to understand what makes music popular on a streaming application to provide user information that could drive music industry decisions as to what artists, style of music, following, etc may predict the popularity of new music content. The website/dashboard page would include visual display of findings along with user driven drop down and user input information in order to provide dynamic charts as well as specified information requested. (Similar to the apps where you can input the day/year of your birth and find out the top song on that day etc).

Data Sources: Spotify API, Last.fm API, Spotify data set from kaggle

Database: PostgreSQL

Project Goals

Analyze music trends in the US to inform industry professionals as well as music enthusiasts about trending artists, genre's, etc.

Challenges: 

Both APIs proved to snarl our progress and hangup/suspend the project. Knowing what we know now, we likely should have abandoned this topic and went a different direction. The kaggle dataset was too large for any of our computers to process. Through class networking we were able to use a program to cut the kaggle dataset into a smaller dataset with only US information but still had challenges importing it to SQL and to Github. With additional time to dig further into the APIs and the added analysis tools we're learning (i.e. machine learning) I believe we can modify this project to make it employer facing and quite impressive prior to the end of the course.
