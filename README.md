Project Intention

Analyze datasets from Spotify and Last.fm to understand what makes music popular on a streaming application to provide user information that could drive music industry decisions as to what artists, style of music, following, etc may predict the popularity of new music content. The website/dashboard page would include visual display of findings along with user driven drop down and user input information in order to provide dynamic charts as well as specified information requested. (Similar to the apps where you can input the day/year of your birth and find out the top song on that day etc).

Data Sources: Spotify API, Last.fm API, Spotify data set from kaggle

Database: PostgreSQL
